1. Give short description each of Linear, RBF, Polynomial kernels used in SVM.

Ans:- SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges.
in SVM there are 3 techniques we used to improve the learning the model.

Linear- In linear SVM data is separated by using a single line.

rbf- rbf is used when the data boundaries are hypothesized to be curve-shaped. It has two main parameter i.e Gamma and C

polynomial-

2 ans:- R squared is better to use because it shows the proportion of the variance of data of model where as 
 RSS is sum of squared distannce between predicted and actual values.

3 ans:- Dont know the answer


4 ans :- Gini impurity is used when we randmoly choose any data and how much or peobability of that data is wrong 
         classified.Its values lies between 0 and 1.

5.

6.


7. Ans :- in bagging same type of predictions are combined but in boosting different types of predictions are combined.

8 Ans:- Don't know

9:- There is a parameter in cross validation is K fold. We use K fold to shuffle the data  randomly and splits
    teh dataset into K groups. Usually we choose K =5. 
10:- Dont know the answer.

11. Don't know the answer.

12.dont know the answer

13.don't know the answer

14. Adaboost increases the accuracy by giving more weightage to the target which is misclassified by the model.
    gradient boosting increases the accuracy by minimizing the Loss.

15:- we can not use  Logistic Regression for classification of Non-Linear Data because we worked for data for two output
     either yes or no. Only logic output is used in logistic output.
